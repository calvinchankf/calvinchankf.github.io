                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    I am from Hong Kong üá≠üá∞, and currently based in UK üá¨üáß
                    
                    I'd describe myself as a product guy, I like building user&customer-facing products. I started my career in 2013 as a mobile app developer, and over the years, I expanded my expertise to frontend, backend, and eventually distributed systems ‚Äî growing from early-stage startups to FAANG.
                    <br><br>
                    Throughout the years, I've grown from a junior individual contributor into a tech lead, taking on responsibilities that span across teams and domains. I take technical ownership of product areas, working closely with stakeholders and customers to explore business opportunities, shape product roadmaps, architect systems, define GTM strategies, and lead+coach engineers from end-to-end execution to deliver impact to millions of businesses and billions of end-users across the globe (thanks Meta and eBay üòò)
                    <br><br>
                    I believe in the motto ‚Äúwe are only 1% finished‚Äù - it means there is always room for improvement, whether on product side or infrastructure's. Also, "nothing is someone else‚Äôs problem" - not only pointing out what a problem is, but also proposing how we should tackle and improve it.
